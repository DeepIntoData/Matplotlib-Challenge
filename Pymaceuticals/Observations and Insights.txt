Observations and Insights

One clear observation that can be made based upon the Mouse Weight vs Avg Tumor Volume is that 
    Average Tumor Volume seems to be directly dependent on the Mouse Weight meaning that the more that the mouse weighs, the bigger the tumor.
    An anomoly in this is for mice weighing around 17g had Tumor Volumes ranging between 34-40 (mm3). The same can be said for mice weighing 19g, 21g, and 23g with the most extreme tendencies occuring on 17g mice
    each with their own respective tumor volumes. This can be compared to to the line plot which is described further below.

    In spite of this fact, the characteristic still holds true. 

A second observation
    According to the box plot of Final Tumor Volume vs Drug Regimen
    Capomulin and Ceftamin seem to have performed the best due to their first quartile being well below its median
    I interpreted this as Final Tumor Volumes being significantely lower than their starting

A third observation
    According to the line plot for Timepoint vs Tumor Volume for Mouse x401 on Capomulin
    At every timepoint +10, there seemed to be a plateau in the tumor volume where the Tumor began to slightly increase before finally decreasing again
